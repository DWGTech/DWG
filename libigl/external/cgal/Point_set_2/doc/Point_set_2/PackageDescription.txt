The two dimensional point set is a class for geometric queries.  It
supports circular, triangular and iso rectangular range searches and
nearest neighbor searches.  The point set is inherited from the \cgal
Delaunay triangulation data type.  That means that it is a dynamic
data structure supporting the insertion and deletion of points.

This package also provides function template versions of the range
search and nearest neighbor query operations. They all have to be
templated by the type of a \cgal Delaunay triangulation and provide
functionality similar to the corresponding member functions of the
point set class.
