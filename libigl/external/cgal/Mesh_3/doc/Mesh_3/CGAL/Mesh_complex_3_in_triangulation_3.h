\ingroup PkgMesh_3MeshClasses

The class `Mesh_complex_3_in_triangulation_3` implements a data structure 
to store the 3D restricted Delaunay triangulation used by a mesh 
generation process. 

This class is a model of the concept 
`MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3`. 


\tparam Tr can be instantiated with any 3D 
regular triangulation of \cgal provided that its 
vertex and cell base class are models of the concepts 
`MeshVertexBase_3` and `MeshCellBase_3`, respectively. 

\tparam  CornerIndex is the type of the indices for corners. It must match the `Corner_index` of the model 
of the `MeshDomainWithFeatures_3` concept used for mesh generation. 

\tparam CurveIndex is the type of the indices for curves. 
It must match the `Curve_index` types of the model 
of the `MeshDomainWithFeatures_3` concept used for mesh generation. 

Those two last template parameters defaults to `int`, so that they can be ignored 
if the domain used for mesh generation does not include 0 and 1-dimensionnal features (i.e 
is a model of the concept `MeshDomain_3`).
