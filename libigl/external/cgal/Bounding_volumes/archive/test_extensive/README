This directory contains additional test programs; these do not go
into the 'test' directory because they take rather long to (compile
and) execute.  Also, since some of the tests require rather large
amounts of input data, we do not include them in final releases (and
consequently, the directory 'test_extensive' is listed in the
'dont_submit' file).

Here's a description of what's inside this directory:

- stability: This directory contains a collection of very degenerate
  configurations of balls, together with their precomputed exact
  miniballs.  The program stability.cpp computes the miniballs of these
  degenerate sets using the default algorithm (Default_algorithm) and
  floating-point arithmetic (double and float) and compares the result
  to the precomputed data.  (You will normally not need to look at,
  let alone compile or run the program stability-exact.cpp; it is used
  to precompute the exact miniballs from the degenerate data and to
  save the result into the directory data.  It takes hours to run...)
