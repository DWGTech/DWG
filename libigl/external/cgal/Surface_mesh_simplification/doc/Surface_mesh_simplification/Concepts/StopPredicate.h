This predicate is called each time an edge is selected for processing, 
before it is collapsed. 

`current_cost` is the cost of the selected edge. 

`initial_count` and `current_count` are the number of initial and current edges. 

If the return value is `true` the simplification terminates before processing the edge, 
otherwise it continues normally.
