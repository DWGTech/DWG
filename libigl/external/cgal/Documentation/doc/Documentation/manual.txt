Organization of the Manual
==========================

This manual is organized in several parts covering the many domains
of computational geometry. Each part consists of several chapters,
and each chapter is split into a *User Manual*  and a *Reference
Manual*. The User Manual gives the general idea and comes with examples.
The Reference Manual presents the \sc{Api} of the various classes
and functions.

The manual has a \ref packages  with a short paragraph explaining
what each package is about, what license
it has, and on which other packages it depends. It further provides
links to precompiled demo programs for the Windows platform.

The manual further has a class index, as well as a search box in the upper right of
each page.
The scope of the search box is the package you currently look at and the 
packages it depends on, or  it is the whole manual when you are in
a top level page such as the package overview.

Organization of the Reference Manual
====================================

The \cgal library is a library of class templates. Consequently, we express
the requirements on template arguments by specifying \em concepts
and by providing \em models for concepts. See \ref intro_concept "here"
for an explanation of concept/model.

The reference manual has pages for concepts and for models,
and just as classes can be derived from other classes, concepts
can \em refine other concepts, by adding requirements.

When a class is a model of a concept, its reference manual 
page has a link to the concept, and the API is mainly documented
on the reference manual page of the concept.  As a concept
may refine another concept, the full API of a class is sometimes
distributed over the pages of base classes and over the pages
of several concepts.

Let's have a look at the vertex type of 3D triangulations.

Models and concepts.
\cgalFigureEnd

The class `CGAL::Triangulation_vertex_base_3` derives from
the class `CGAL::Triangulation_ds_vertex_base_3`. 
The two classes are models of the concepts `TriangulationVertexBase_3`
and `TriangulationDSVertexBase_3`, respectively.
The former concept refines the latter.

In the reference manual pages of these concepts and models
only the methods and types which are not greyed in 
\cgalFigureRef{Manual_Fig_concept_model} are documented.
Inherited methods are only documented in the base class.
And methods that must be implemented in order to be a
model of a concept are only documented in the concept.

As pointed out in Section \ref intro_concept "Concepts and Models" 
the notion of a \em concept is about requirements,
and it can be a required global function or a required traits class.
