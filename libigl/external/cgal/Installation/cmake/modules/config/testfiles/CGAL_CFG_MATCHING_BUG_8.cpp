//| This flag is set if the compiler bugs with some "using Base::Member;" in

#define MATCHING_BUG_8 1
#include "CGAL_CFG_MATCHING_BUG_7.cpp"

// VC++12 both says that the call to `wconv(p)` is ambiguous:
//
// config\testfiles\CGAL_CFG_MATCHING_BUG_7.cpp(61) : error C2666: 'WConv::operator ()' : 2 overloads have similar conversions
// 
//         config\testfiles\CGAL_CFG_MATCHING_BUG_7.cpp(51): could be 'void WConv::operator ()(const WP &)'
// 
//         unable to recover from previous error(s); stopping compilation
