//| This flag is set if the compiler bugs with some "using Base::Member;" in
//| a derived class.  The workaround is to write a forwarder or not use using.
//| At least SunPro CC 5.3 has this bug where the typical error message is :
//| "Error: The function B<int>::g() has not had a body defined."
//| Note that the subtlely is that the error message does not mention
//| "Member"...
//| This test is updated (hijacked) to detect an issue with sunpro 5.9
//| that instantiates a function twice.
