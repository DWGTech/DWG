# - Defines Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS and Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
# 
# This module sets the CMake variables:
# 
# == Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ==
# 
# The option CGAL_Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS is created in the cache, as
# advanced option. If CGALConfig.cmake has been loaded, the default value
# of that option is the value loaded from CGALConfig.cmake (this file was
# created during the configuration of CGAL libraries). Otherwise, the
# default value of that option is OFF.
# 
# The variable Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS is set to the value of the option
# CGAL_Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS.
# 
# Additionally, if Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS is OFF, and the auto-linking is
# enabled, the definition BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK is added to
# CGAL_3RD_PARTY_DEFINITIONS, so that the auto-linking feature on Windows
# knows that it must search for dynamic libraries.
# 
# == Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS ==
# 
# The variable Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS is filled with a long list of
# Boost versions. That allows the module FindBoost to find more recent
# Boost versions, even if the file FindBoost.cmake is old.
