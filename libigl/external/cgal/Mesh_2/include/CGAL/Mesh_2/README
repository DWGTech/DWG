No header in this sub-directory, but Face_badness.h, is documented. They
are internal headers of the Mesh_2 packages, and should not be used.

If you want to use some undocumented functionnality, please contact me
(Laurent Rineau <laurent.rineau@ens.fr>) so that we can see if I can move
some internal details to the documented interface.
