\cgalPkgDesc{The surface mesh class provided by this package is an implementation
 of the halfedge data structure allowing to represent polyhedral surfaces. It is
an alternative to the packages \ref PkgHDSSummary and \ref PkgPolyhedronSummary.
The main differences are that it is indexed based and not pointer based,
and that the mechanism for adding information to vertices, halfedges, edges,
and faces is much simpler and can be used at runtime and not at compile time.}
