Subject: CGAL 4.12 Beta 2 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.12 Beta 2
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.


CGAL version 4.12 Beta 2 is a public testing release. It should provide
a solid ground to report bugs that need to be tackled before the
release of the final version of CGAL 4.12 in April.


*WARNING*: This release features an important change of the CMake scripts
used to configure the CGAL libraries and examples. Developers using
makefiles or the Ninja build-system should set the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to
`Release` manually, to avoid using CGAL libraries without any compile-time
optimization. Please read the first paragraph of the release notes
carefully.


Note that, since the release CGAL-4.12 Beta 1, the header-only mode of CGAL
has been modified, and documented.


Besides fixes and general enhancement to existing packages, the following
has changed since CGAL 4.11:


Using CGAL Header-only

- It is now possible to use CGAL without configuring it with CMake, as a
  header-only library. Note that, even if CGAL is header-only, its
  dependencies (such as GMP and MPFR) are not all header-only.


2D Movable Separability of Sets (new package)

-   A new package called "2D Movable Separability of Sets" has been
    introduced. It handles a class of problems that deal with moving
    sets of objects in the plane; the challenge is to avoid collisions
    between the objects while considering different kinds of motions and
    various definitions of separation.

    At this point this package consists of the implementations of
    various predicates and constructions related to castings of
    polygonal objects. In particular, it can be used to determine
    whether a feasible mold for a polygonal object does exist. If a mold
    exists, the package can also be used to compute all possible
    orientations of the feasible molds and the corresponding motions
    needed to remove the casted object from the mold.


Classification (new package)

-   This package offers an algorithm that classifies a data set into a
    user-defined set of labels (such as ground, vegetation, buildings,
    etc.). A flexible API is provided so that users can classify any
    type of data, compute their own local features on the input data
    set, and define their own labels.


Kinetic Data Structures (removed package)

-   This package has been removed from CGAL-4.12. Users of the package
    will have to keep using the source code available in CGAL-4.11 or
    earlier.

changes.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
