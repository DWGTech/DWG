Point Set Shape Detection

Sven Oesau, Yannick Verdie, Clément Jamin and Pierre Alliez

This CGAL package implements an efficient RANSAC (random sample consensus) approach for detecting shapes in a point set with unoriented normals. 
Five canonical shapes can be detected: planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori.
Additional shapes can be detected, provided a class derived from the base shape is implemented.
