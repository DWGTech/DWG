Geometry-central is a modern C++ library of data structures and algorithms for geometry processing, with a particular focus on surface meshes.

Features include:

- A polished **surface mesh** class, with efficient support for mesh modification, and a system of containers for associating data with mesh elements.
- Implementations of canonical **geometric quantities** on surfaces, ranging from normals and curvatures to tangent vector bases to operators from discrete differential geometry.
- A suite of **powerful algorithms**, including computing distances on surface, generating direction fields, and manipulating intrinsic Delaunay triangulations.
- A coherent set of sparse **linear algebra tools**, based on Eigen and augmented to automatically utilize better solvers if available on your system.


**Sample:**

```cpp
// Load a mesh
std::unique_ptr<SurfaceMesh> mesh;
std::unique_ptr<VertexPositionGeometry> geometry;
std::tie(mesh, geometry) = readSurfaceMesh("spot.obj"); 

// Compute vertex areas
VertexData<double> vertexAreas(*mesh);

geometry->requireFaceAreas();
for(Vertex v : mesh->vertices()) {
  double A = 0.;
  for(Face f : v.adjacentFaces()) {
    A += geometry->faceAreas[f] / v.degree();
  }
  vertexAreas[v] = A;
}
```
